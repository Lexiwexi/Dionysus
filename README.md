# Dionysus v.0.0
Dionysus is a discord bot written in python using the discord API for python and Flask for the temporary webserver. Command Documentation will follow soon.

# Required:
- Python 3.x
- discordpy (discordpy.readthedocs.io/)
- Flask (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)


# TO MAKE THIS CODE WORK...
You will need to edit the following script to contain your bot Token
- .env

Dionysus also needs to be run from a server to work, preferably repl.it as it has been developed there. The code will set up it's own webpage to keep alive for a while but will eventually shut down. This is a work in progress.


# Known Bugs:
- None so far but I am not really bugtesting yet
